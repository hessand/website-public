This was a fairly substantial undertaking aimed at introducing new financial API's to Bluemix, as well as creating a better project management system in Bluemix.<br/><br/>I was leading a team of three developers to deliver this experience and integrate and extend Bluemix's CloudFoundry backend, and was also working as a UX designer in the initial weeks of this project.<br/><br/>This work ended up headlining a conference, and also showcased the Investment Insights with Watson software that I also created.<br/><br/><a href='http://www.bluemix.net/finance'>View Live Site</a>",
