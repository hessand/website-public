Watson Analytics is a BI tool to help users understand and visualize both live and static data.<br/><br/>I worked mostly on the UX of the 'Display' section of Watson Analytics which encompassed many of the aspects of dashboarding and creating reports.<br/><br/>As part of this work, I also created a consumable style guide for the dev team to ensure consistency in styles / colors / componentry where possible, which was later integrated into many other products in the portfolio."
